# eslint-plugin-no-esnext

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/isiahmeadows/eslint-plugin-no-esnext.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/isiahmeadows/eslint-plugin-no-esnext)

Ban constructs not supported by a particular ES version, while still allowing ES `import`/`export`. It's a lot like setting `parserOptions.ecmaVersion`, but without stopping you from using `import`/`export`. This is very useful if you use Rollup, target legacy browsers, and don't feel like using Babel, Bubl√©, or the like.

### Installation

1. Install it via npm or Yarn.

    ```
    npm install isiahmeadows/eslint-plugin-no-esnext
    yarn add github:isiahmeadows/eslint-plugin-no-esnext
    ```

2. Add `no-esnext` to your ESLint plugins.

    ```js
    plugins: ["no-esnext"],
    ```

3. Add `no-esnext/no-esnext` to your rules, replacing `5` here (the default supported version) with whatever ECMAScript version you wish to limit yourself to.

    ```js
    rules: {
        "no-esnext/no-esnext": ["error", 5],
    },
    ```

    The following ECMAScript versions are supported, with their appropriate names:

    - ES3: `3`
    - ES5: `5`
    - ES6: `6` or `2015`
    - ES7: `7` or `2016`
    - ES8: `8` or `2017`
    - ES9: `9` or `2018`
    - ES10: `10` or `2019`

And you're good to go.

### Contributing

Code is in `index.js` here in the root, and `test.js` has all the tests. I use [Thallium](https://github.com/isiahmeadows/thallium/tree/v0.3.12/docs) for the test runner and [Clean Assert](https://github.com/isiahmeadows/clean-assert) for the assertions. This is all linted with ESLint + my personal config.

- To get set up for the first time, just run `npm install`
- To lint, run `npm run lint`
- To lint and run tests, run `npm test`
